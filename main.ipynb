It's probably worth noting that we got a warning that the filesystem is `too small for a journal`, which means tha at least one of the features was disabled. Assuming that fs.img is already a valid filesystem, I won't bother to figure out what difference lack of journal makes - at least not for now. It also appears that we have room for 16 inodes, so I would guess I can't put more than 16 files in there. Before we try to mount the filesystem, let's take a brief look at the hexdump of the file (`*` means \"row repeated\"):"
